// TODO: Test the GUI here <======== 5 (head)
// Just checked and it is possible using BufferedImage.getRGB(int x, int y) to probe the pixels in the buffered image
// The test should be simple. The window class will be used to instantiate the GUI and drawing instructions will be given
// The SimulationPanel should make it's BufferedImage available in the SimulationGraphicsInterface so we can test some pixels in the image
// to make sure the drawing instructions are getting there
